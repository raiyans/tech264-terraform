### 1. What is IaC?

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable files (code), rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

### 2. Benefits of IaC

- **Consistency**: Avoid configuration drift by having the same setup for different environments.
- **Automation**: Infrastructure can be deployed automatically, reducing manual effort.
- **Version Control**: All infrastructure changes can be tracked, audited, and rolled back using version control systems like Git.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale infrastructure up or down based on changing needs.

### 3. When/Where to Use IaC

- **When Scaling**: If you need to scale infrastructure quickly and consistently.
- **Cloud Environments**: Ideal for managing cloud resources (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Multi-environment Consistency**: Useful when deploying to multiple environments (development, staging, production).
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: For automating the deployment of infrastructure at scale.

### 4. Tools Available for IaC

- **Terraform**: Open-source IaC tool for managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Ansible**: Automation tool focused on configuration management and deployment.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS-specific tool for managing AWS resources.
- **Puppet/Chef**: Older tools focused on configuration management and deployment.

### 5. What is Configuration Management (CM)?

**Configuration Management (CM)** refers to maintaining systems, servers, and software in a consistent state. It ensures that configurations are managed and updated systematically across environments.

- **Tools**: Puppet, Chef, and Ansible.

### 6. What is Provisioning of Infrastructure?

Provisioning refers to the process of setting up and configuring infrastructure resources such as servers, databases, and networks.
- **Tools to do it?**: Terraform, AWS cloud formation.
- **Do CM Tools Do It?**: Yes, tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef can provision infrastructure by automating server setups, networking, and application deployments.

### 7. What is Ansible and How Does it Work?

**Ansible** is an open-source automation tool used for IT tasks like configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.

- **How It Works**: Ansible uses **playbooks** (written in YAML) that define tasks to be performed on remote machines. It operates agentlessly over SSH, meaning no special software is needed on the managed nodes.

### 8. Who is Using IaC and Ansible in the Industry?

- **Tech Companies**: Major companies like Netflix, Facebook, and Spotify use IaC tools (Terraform, Ansible) to manage and scale their infrastructure.
- **Enterprise**: Financial institutions and healthcare providers use IaC to maintain regulatory compliance and automate operations.
